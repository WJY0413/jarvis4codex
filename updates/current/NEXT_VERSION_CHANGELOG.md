# Jarvis 0.1.1

## Capability input port

- Added `jarvis-capability-request/v1` and `jarvis-capability-receipt/v1`.
- Added a caller-owned `JarvisCapabilityPort` for monitor, resume,
  monitor-to-resume composition, and heartbeat control requests.
- The Port leaves HostBridge adaptation and external delivery outside the
  standard package; each caller supplies its own integration adapter.
- No scheduler, credential, or existing runtime state is migrated by this release.
